2019.1.3 New Test Windows Aec SDK Demo

VS cmd -out 123.pcm

Mode 0 is the AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation) mode and If you need play some audio signal through the render device selected for loopback capture. Please refer the Readme file included in the SDK. If you get 0x87CC000A, it means that there is no audio being rendered. As a result there is no loopback data and ProcessOutput fails. Please give it a try.
